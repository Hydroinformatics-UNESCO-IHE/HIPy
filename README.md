HydroInformatics tools for Python.

This toolbox is developed and sustained at UNESCO-IHE in Delft, NL.

At this stage the development of this repository is starting, so be patient.

For the use of these tools you might need so far...:

  -> Numpy (http://www.numpy.org/)
  -> pyOpt (http://www.pyopt.org/)
  -> Cython (http://cython.org/)
  -> scikit-learn (http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
