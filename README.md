HydroInformatics tools for Python.

This toolbox is developed and sustained at UNESCO-IHE in Delft, NL. This aim to provide modelling tools for water resource management.

At this stage the development of this repository is starting, so be patient.

For the use of these tools you might need so far...:

  -> Numpy (http://www.numpy.org/)
  
  -> pyOpt (http://www.pyopt.org/)
  
  -> Cython (http://cython.org/)
  
  -> scikit-learn (http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
  

Regards,

Juan Chacon

The core of this toolbox is being developed within the EU-WP7 WeSenseIt project (http://wesenseit.com/)
